# Using Netube

Netube represents the functionality of an online-streaming service application. For legal reasons, there are no real movies to be played, just the experience of navigating through the app.

Due to the high traffic of API calls being made to the used API, some data does not appear right away. 

If this is the case, simply refresh your browser and wait 5 seconds. 

If the issue persists and NO data is being loaded, please reach out to either Noah or myself for a live demonstration.

* Note - The API being used is a "free to use" API from "themoviedb.org". We do not have control over the speed and quality of the API response.
